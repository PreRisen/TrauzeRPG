Tiers of Armor from Ore / monster drops.

Certain monster drops can be crafted into unique gear.

Tiers of Potions.

Tiers of Foods.

Level Cap start off 10 for balancing reasons.

Want there to be a grind, but casually. We can start off with beginner equipment and there could be new armors introduced every 5 levels or so.
since cap will be 10 we can start small and progressively add more and more.

Not sure if there should be classes or player can equip anything. It'd probably be best for classes to give players specific roles when completing group
content.
